# CS230 Deep Learning Project
Every year vehicle collisions with large livestock cause untold damage to life and property. In
Arizona, like in other open-range states, many drivers donâ€™t realize the real hazard and frequency of
livestock on the road until it is too late.
Studies have shown that motorist alert signage that is activated specifically at the time and place of the
hazard have higher effectiveness in preventing collisions with wildlife than signs alone. Current radar
based systems activate whenever there is a car even if there is no current animal hazard, essentially a
false positive from the point of view of the motorist.
Using video to detect the hazard and notify drivers of impending hazard with alert activated signs
could be a cost effective method to prevent a number accidents.
What makes this project interesting from a deep learning point of view are the challenges which make
it more complicated than a normal object detection problem.
